        <h3>A data-driven solution to dominating your league.</h3>

<p>Fixtoire is a new proprietary analytics engine that takes the guesswork out of your Fantasy Premier League squad selection. While your opponents may base their transfer policy off upcoming fixtures, team form and market movement, Fixtoire gives careful consideration to many additional factors: exhaustive player statistics from seasons past, how each new signing performed with his previous team and even prevailing weather conditions.</p>

<p>We crunch all of that data through an adaptation of the Markov Decision Process, and augment our algorithm with neural network functionality so that it learns and adapts from real-world game outcomes. With Fixtoire, you'll never lose another Gameweek.</p>

<p>Coming soon.</p>
